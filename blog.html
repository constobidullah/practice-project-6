  <h1>1. What is the defferences between localStorage and sessionStorage ? </h1>
  <p class="paragraph-style">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>
