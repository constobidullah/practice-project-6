   <h1>Question no - 01</h1>
   <h2>What is the defferences between localStorage and sessionStorage ? </h2>
   <p class="paragraph-style">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
      localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is
      loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

   <h1>Question no - 03</h1>
   <h2>How does the javaScript event loop work ? </h2>
   <p class="paragraph-style"> The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If
      the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
      Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
